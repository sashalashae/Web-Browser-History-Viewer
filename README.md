By Sasha Morgan
Class: ECE 2574

##Project Description

The program will allow a user to view, search, and remove entries from a history file.

Using the implementation of either the array or linked list classes from part one, write a program hviewer.cpp to read a filename from the command line that contains a list of web browsing activity. If the user does not supply a filename your program should attempt to open the file history.csv in the current directory.
